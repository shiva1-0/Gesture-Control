## Hardware Integration:
- Utilized three ultrasonic sensors to capture precise hand movements. Each sensor was strategically placed to detect different directional gestures, providing comprehensive spatial recognition.
- The sensors measured the distance between the hand and the laptop, interpreting various gestures such as swipes, taps, and holds.

## Programming and Control:
- Programmed the Arduino microcontroller using the Arduino IDE, employing C/C++ for efficient and responsive gesture recognition.
- Implemented algorithms to process sensor data and convert it into control signals for the laptop.
- Used Python in conjunction with the PyAutoGUI library to translate these signals into automated keyboard actions, allowing seamless control of the laptop interface.

## Data Communication:
- Established serial communication via USB port to facilitate real-time data transfer between the Arduino and the laptop.
- The Arduino continuously sent sensor data to the laptop, which was then processed by the Python script to execute corresponding actions on the laptop.
